## üöÄ Welcome to the build-a-minimal-app challenge! üöÄ

The challenge for you is to **build a minimal software/app that you think VandyHacks will benefit from**.

Your product should be a solution to a problem faced by VandyHacks. It could be a tool, a platform, or anything that can improve the experience for organizers, attendees, or any other stakeholders.

_Note: You are not expected to build a functioning app. You only need to implement the high-level features of your app, and dive deep into one or two core features such that there is enough code for us to gauge your coding ability._

### Help us!

We would by lying if we say we don't experience any challenges while running our annual hackathon. So below are **real/similar** problems faced by us:

-   **Presidents üßë‚Äçüè´:** "Every year, we spend a lot of time scheduling interviews with applicants and conducting follow-ups. If only there is a way to make recruitment easier..."

-   **Content üìπ:** "We have conducted a lot of workshops over the years, but they are spread across different platforms. If only there is a centralized place for all our videos..."

-   **Development üßë‚Äçüíª:** "Every year, We curate new coding problems for people who apply to dev (that's option 1 üòâ), but there is not an easy way to automate the grading process of all our applicants. If only there is a platform to automatically generate problems and automatically grade applicants..."

-   **Design üßë‚Äçüé®:** "We want to help dev create a visually appealing judging schedule that all hackers and judges can collectively look at. If only dev has enough time to implement this..."

-   **Operations üì¶:** "We have a lot of physical items to manage, such as t-shirts, stickers, and swag, but it's difficult to keep track of inventory and ensure that everything is delivered on time. If only there is an easy way to manage and track these items..."

-   **Hacker Experience ü§π:** "We want to make sure all participants have a positive experience during the hackathon, but it's hard to get feedback and know what we can improve on. If only there is a way to easily gather and analyze feedback from the participants..."

-   **Marketing üì£:** "We manage our Instagram, Twitter, TikTok page and so it is a little tedious to check our analytics (follower counts) everyday. If only there is a centralized place for all our important social media statistics..."

-   **Sponsorship üí∞:** "We have a lot of email templates that we use to cold-send potential sponsors, but we don't know which ones are the most effective. If only there is a way to A/B test our emails templates..."

**You are not limited to these problems.** Feel free to come up with your own interpretation of the type of problems that hackathon organizations like VandyHacks might experience!

### What do I need to submit?

You need to submit:

1.  A README file with the following sections:

    -   Explain the problem you seek to solve
    -   Explain your proposed app
    -   Provide visual screenshots/video of your app (highly recommended):
        -   It could also be a video of terminal output (if you choose to go for the backend route)
    -   Provide a screenshot of two core features you implemented and provide an explanation of your thought process
    -   (optional) Your comments on this project
        -   Did you enjoy this challenge?
        -   What else were you thinking when implementing your idea?

2.  All of your code.

**Note:** You _must_ use git version control to keep track of your progress throughout the entirety of this challenge. Not only is this a beneficial skill to have, your colleagues will also thank you for documenting your work with git commits.

### How will I be graded?

You will be graded on:

1. Technical execution and quality of the code
2. Code Organization & Readability
    - How well do you structure your code?
    - Is it easily understood by otheres?
3. Code Style
    - Do you use proper spacing and variable naming?
    - Do you write comments when appropriate?
4. Language used
5. Good Development Practices
    - Do you use git to frequently commit your progress along the way?
    - Is your codebase reasonably easy to navigate by a fresh pair of eyes?
    - Is your code well documented?

You will NOT be penalized by having a 'bad' idea. So if you are afraid that your idea isn't good enough, do not worry : ) We only look at the technical aspect!

### Questions

**Q: This is so open-ended! How should I approach this challenge?**

A: You will encounter more open ended problems in the real world, so this is only a taster üòõ. In fact, this challenge is an opportunity for you to show us what your strengths are, and you definitely should leverage upon this if you feel that normal coding challenges do not best fully capture your strengths.

For example:

-   If you are stronger at frontend, you could implement an app with emphasis on the user-side with routings and data manipulation.
-   If you are stronger at backend, you could implement the backend or business logic of your idea and attach a video of it working in the terminal/command line.

It is up to you to choose the medium in which to showcase your strengths. We do not penalize on anything. Just make sure that your submission include your code because we are, after all, the dev team.

**Q: How much time am I expected to spend on this?**

A: It depends on how efficient you are with your time, but you should not expect to spend more than 6 hours total. Here is a word of advice: more time spent does not necessarily mean a better score from us. So, focus on the quality of your code rather than the quantity of features. It is a useful skill to be efficient with your time (we are still working on it ü•≤).

**Q: Does my app need to function?**

A: No! You are not required to develop a functioning app. You are only required to implement 1-2 **core** features of your app idea. Keep the scope small and concise!
