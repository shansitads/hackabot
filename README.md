# ðŸš€ VandyHacks Dev Assessment 2023 ðŸš€

Thank you for expressing interest in the VandyHacks Dev Committee! VH dev is a committee for those who are passionate about the development side of VandyHacks. We have a decade-long history of creating a variety of apps and software, thanks to the self-motivated and committed VandyHacks students who, like you, were once applicants!

This assessment serves as a way for us to hopefully get an accurate sense of your skills and your level of comfort with challenging problems. It is also an opportunity for you to get an idea of the problems we solve at VH dev.

We hope that in the process you would have some fun with these challenges! _(it took us a good effort to curate these for you ðŸ¥º)_

## The Challenge

As VandyHacks' dev committee, we value the spirit of hackathons, and we are actively taking the effort to make dev a place that supports wild and thoughtful ideas.

This is why we have decided to step outside of the convention and spice things up for this year's dev takehome assessment!

**You have the option to choose from the following two challenges this year:**

1. Complete a series of coding problems that test your problem-solving skills.
2. Build a minimal software/app that you think VandyHacks will benefit from.

Good luck and all the best!

## Option 1: Coding Problems

If you choose to take on this challenge, then the folders that should concern you is [option1](option1). Head to [option1/README.md](option1/README.md) to read more about the challenges.

## Option 2: Build a minimal app

If you choose to take on this challenge, then the folder that should concern you is [option2](option2). Head to [option2/README.md](option2/README.md) to read more about the challenge.

## Questions

Have any questions? See if these would help answer them. If not, email us at jia.yin.leong@vanderbilt.edu (Adaline) and zi.nean.teoh@vanderbilt.edu (Zi) -- we are more than happy to help you out!

**Q: When can I start?**

A: Now!

**Q: When is the deadline?**

A: Deadline: 11:00PM Monday January 30th, 2023. No further commits will be accepted after that.

**Q: What resources can I use?**

A: You can use any online resources such as documentation, tutorials, or forums to help you solve the challenges, but you should not be asking others to write code for you. You should be working on this independently.

**Q: Can I use Copilot or ChatGPT?**

A: No, because the use of Copilot and ChatGPT falls under the category of "asking others to write code for you." Do also keep in mind that in the later stages we may ask you to explain your code verbally or we may question your code. It is easy to tell if somebody wrote all their code themselves.

**Q: Which languages should I use?**

A: You can use any programming language that you are comfortable with. However, we'll give a slight bonus for JavaScript, and a slightly bigger bonus to TypeScript with all other languages being treated equally. We do this because VandyHacks tech stack is mostly JS/TS, and it is important that your skillset matches our need.

_Note: Since all JS is technically valid TS, we will not count your project as using TS unless it can pass the transpiler under `strict: true` mode. Non-strict TS will be counted as JavaScript._

**Q: What if I have no experience with JavaScript/TypeScript?**

A: You can either go with the language you are most comfortable with, or take this opportunity to learn JavaScript/TypeScript! Being able to program in different languages is a testament to your versality as a developer. Ask us for help if you choose to embark on the journey of the unknown!

**Q: How will I be graded?**

A: For both options, we will grade on:

-   Code Organization & Readability
    -   How well do you structure your code?
    -   Is it easily understood by others?
-   Code Style
    -   Do you use proper spacing and variable naming?
    -   Do you write comments when appropriate?
-   Language Used

To learn about the specifics of how grading works for the option you choose, read the `option1/README.md` or `option2/README.md`, respectively!

**Q: Which option should I choose?**

A: It is up to you! Both options will test your abilities, but one may align better with your strengths. We recommend that you choose the option that you feel most confident and excited about!

**Q: Will I have an advantage for choosing option (1/2) over the other?**

A: It's a bit of both, yes and no. Yes because, in the event where we have a large pool of applicants, we may consider the options chosen and whether one's submission stands out more in comparison to others. No because we also consider other aspects such as your application and interview.

**Q: What should I expect after I completed this challenge?**

A: Look out for an interview from us! Then, depending on your performance, your application, and your interview, we may invite you for a follow up pair programming interview. You will learn more about this after the interview.
