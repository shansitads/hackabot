## ðŸš€ Welcome to the coding challenge! ðŸš€

There are three levels to this challenge, from level 1 to level 3. The challenge for you is to **solve each level to the best of your ability**.

This set of problems reflect the type of algorithmic challenges that we often face while developing for VandyHacks. There is a folder per level, and each folder contains a README. There, you will find further instructions for the problem, inputs, and everything you'll need to solve the problem.

### What do I need to submit?

For each level, you will need to submit a .json or .txt file in the respective folder.

The README in each folder will tell you the details of how you should name your file.

You also need to submit the code you used to solve the level. You should add the files to the level folder they're for. If you have any particular notes on how you did a specific level, inside that level's folder, include a file called `notes.md`.

In terms of submitting code, we'd prefer if you submitted a single file of code for each level within that level's folder. This should be easy to do with languages like JavaScript or Python. That said, if you prefer to use a language where one big project is more manageable (like C++ with CMake), you may make a top level folder in the repository with all your code. We ask that it be easy to identify the classes and/or methods you used for each problem - it should be obvious to a reader of your code how to execute your solutions for each level.

In addition to submitting your code, please include instructions in a file called `instructions.txt` or `instructions.md` that describe how to run your code. This should include what languages to install, and what dependencies to download.

### How will I be graded?

You will be graded on:

1. Correctness of your algorithm
    - Does it output the correct result?
2. Code Organization & Readability
    - How well do you structure your code?
    - Is it easily understood by otheres?
3. Code Style
    - Do you use proper spacing and variable naming?
    - Do you write comments when appropriate?
4. Language used

### Where do I find my inputs?

To spice things up, every applicants will receive a different input. To receive your unique input data, you will need to go to https://inputs.vandyhacks.dev/

Simply enter your github username and press "Get your input to level X".
